## This is an adaptive denosing of DOA and a beamformer design 
** Scenario **:
We consider a uniform linear array with N elements and the inter-element spacing d = λ/2.
The output x(t) of this array is modeled as\
 $\mathbf{x}(t)=\mathbf{a}( \theta_s(t) )s(t)+\mathbf{a}( \theta_i(t))\mathbf{i}(t)+\mathbf{n}(t)$
 where $t=1,2,...,L$\
 The raw data consists of theta_s (noisy DOA of signal), theta_i (noisy DOA of interference) and the recived signal matX.

Solution:
We
